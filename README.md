# YOUTUBE DATA HARVESTING and WAREHOUSING using SQL and STREAMLIT
## Introduction 
* YouTube, the online video-sharing platform, has revolutionized the way we consume and interact with media. Launched in 2005, it has grown into a global phenomenon, serving as a hub for entertainment, education, and community engagement. With its vast user base and diverse content library, YouTube has become a powerful tool for individuals, creators, and businesses to share their stories, express themselves, and connect with audiences worldwide.

* This project extracts the particular youtube channel data by using the youtube channel id, processes the data, and stores it in the SQL database. Then analyse the data and give the results depending on the customer questions.
